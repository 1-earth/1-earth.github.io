          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
          <p>
            We may use information obtained from cookies or similar technology.
            Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which
            we download onto your computer or device when you visit our website.
            Therefore, when we refer to “you” in this section we mean your
            computer. We can recognise these cookies on subsequent visits and
            they allow us to remember you. Cookies come in many forms. We have
            set out below the main types and categories of cookies that are
            used. This section refers to all types and categories of cookies and
            not just those we use on our website. First and third-party cookies
            - whether a cookie is first-party or third-party refers to the
            domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a
            website that is being visited by the user, the website displayed in
            the URL window e.g. www.madethought.com. Third-Party cookies are
            cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website
            being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another
            entity sets a cookie through that website this would be a
            third-party cookie. Persistent cookies – these cookies remain on a
            user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They
            are activated each time that the user visits the website that
            created that particular cookie. Session cookie – these cookies allow
            website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser
            session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser
            window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session
            cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all
            session cookies are deleted.
          </p>
          <h3>What do we use cookies for?</h3>
          <p>
            Cookies fall into one or more of the categories set out below. This
            website uses cookies that fall into all the categories. Also we use
            data from targeting cookies placed on your computer by third parties
            when you have visited other websites.

              Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies enable services you
              have specifically asked for. These cookies are essential in order
              to enable you to move around the website and use its features,
              such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these

              use a website, for instance which pages users go to most often,
              and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t
              collect information that identifies a visitor. All information
              these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. They
              are only used to improve how the website works.

              on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised
              and they cannot track your browsing activity to other websites.

          <h2>Your rights</h2>
          <p>You are entitled to ask:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              for a copy of the personal information we hold about you, and
              details about how we are processing your personal information;
            </li>
            <li>
              to have any inaccuracies in your personal information corrected;
            </li>
            <li>
              if we are processing your personal information by automated means
              and on the basis of your consent (see “How do we use it?”, above),
              for us to provide your personal information to you in a
              structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format. You can
              also ask us to provide your personal information directly to a
              third party in this format, and, if technically feasible, we will
              do so; and
            </li>
            <li>
              to have your personal information erased, or for our use of it to
              be restricted (for example, if your preferences change, or if you
              don’t want us to send you the information you have requested).
              Please contact us using the details set out below if you would
              like to exercise any of these rights. You also have the right to

              with how we’ve handled your personal information. In the UK, the
              supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner's Office (<a
