<b>about this site</b>

it runs on my raspberry pi, which lives confortably in my living room. the setup is very simple for now, I'm just using FreeBSD and crond to control my services, deploys are automatic each 6 hours, and everything is run without root privileges. i no longer need DDNS as i finaly managed to a fixed IP from my ISP, and my router does all the boring stuff like DDoS protection, firewall and NAT.

All in all, including the OS uses just 200MiB of my precious RAM. it has less than 1kb of size and renders instantly, this demands less from my rpi and from your browser without losing style. this is part of my effort to create a better web.
